# RockbusterStealthDataAnalysis
Data-driven analysis to answer critical business queries for their business strategy. I use SQL to identify top and bottom-performing movies, analyze rental durations, map out customer geography, pinpoint high-value customer locations, and compare sales across regions.
# Introduction 
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that used to have stores worldwide. Facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, the Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use I ts existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service to stay competitive.
# Key Questions and Objectives
Here are the main questions Rockbuster's BOM asks me to answer:
* Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
* What was the average rental duration for all videos?
* Which countries are Rockbuster customers based i n?
* Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
* Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

The dataset includes information on Rockbuster's film inventory, customers, and transactions, loaded into a PostgreSQL database. It's structured to reflect real-world business scenarios and relationships between different data tables.
